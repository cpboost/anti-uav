1. Environment Setup:
Refer to: https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/3rd_Anti-UAV_CVPR23/summary.
note:
a) We recommend that you use python==3.8，or conflicts may occur;
b) For those using NVIDIA RTX 30 & 40 series GPUs，the cuda 11.8 has been tested successfully;
c) when you run the command
pip install -r requirements/cv.txt
There might be some problems, like unable to find bmt_clipit, clip, panopticapi, videofeatures_clipit. And these errors can be ignored;
d) You need to install jibjpeg4py library and jittor==1.3.8.5.

2. Data Preparation:
Currently, we offer three public datasets for ANTI-UAV task.

Please note that 410 and 600 versions only contain IR videos while 300 version contains both RGB videos and IR videos. In this release, the model is capable of dealing with both RGB data and IR data, so we recommend that you use the 300 version dataset.

3. Running
#Training
In the root path of the project, run the command
python ltr/run_training.py modal modal


Frequently FAQs (keep updating):
